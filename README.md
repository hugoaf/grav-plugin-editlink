# grav-plugin-editlink
Adds an edit link in frontend

# Attention it is in Betta for now

This little plugin does what it says, It just adds links in the frontend to edit, so you can click it and go directly to the admin area and edit corresponding page.

## How to Install
Copy entire `editlink` folder to your `\users\plugins\`

## How to use it
For now just enable the plugin to show the buttons and disalbe to hide.

## Planned
To show links only when a logged in user in admin area is detected in session.

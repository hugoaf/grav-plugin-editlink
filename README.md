# Edit Link
Adds an edit link in frontend of your grav site

### Plugin now shows links for all visitors, DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION

This little plugin does what it says, It just adds links in the frontend to edit, so you can click it and go directly to the admin area and edit corresponding page. Of course, it requieres the Amin panel to be installed and fully functional.


### How to Install
Create a new folder `\users\plugins\editlink\` and add all files to it.


### How to use it
- For now, just enable the plugin to show the buttons and disable to hide.
- As the correct link positioning depends on the template, there are two options in plugin parameters, to wrap page content in a div with relative positioning, or just output the link with absolute positioning.


#### Planned
To show links only to logged in users and hide for the rest.
